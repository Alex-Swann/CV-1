I am a former scientist who studied BSc Molecular Biology and Genetics in Turkey, and MSc Pharmacology at the University of Oxford. Soon after graduation, I started working as an account handler in the pharmaceutical industry. After 4 years of account management my passion for learning, creating and problem solving led me to discover my interest in learning how to code. To pursue this, I attended Makers Academy, a 12-week bootcamp, to study web development. During this time, I enjoyed overcoming new challenges, solving problems and researching every day. I learned the importance of writing test-driven clean code, how to learn, and asking the right questions. I gained the confidence not to be afraid of the unknown. Interestingly, I also discovered that I have a great talent for table tennis.

I am looking for a developer role which provides opportunities to learn and grow in a fun and exciting environment (and ideally put my table tennis skills to the test).

#### Problem solving

I have always loved tackling new challenges and seeking out new opportunities to learn. During my time as an account handler I learned to apply this skill under pressure and deliver client projects to tight timelines.

Since I joined Makers Academy my passion for problem solving has pushed me to research, read and experiment more to find solutions to problems that I came across during the course. In all of the projects I have worked on during Makers Academy, I found errors very intriguing, and I discovered that tackling errors and problems quickly became my favourite way of learning.

#### Mentoring

I believe that teaching is one of the best ways you can learn. I mentored for 2 years during my previous career in addition to working as a private tutor during my studies. I was quite excited to apply my mentoring skills to help another budding coder at Makers Academy. I really enjoyed sharing my knowledge on coding, answering questions and giving advice based on the recent experiences I had at Makers. Helping my mentee as well as others in the cohort made me realise how important it is to give back, and share knowledge to grow.

#### Working as a part of a team

During both my studies and career, I worked as part of both small and big teams. As an account manager I also led teams for over 3 years. The most successful projects I delivered were the result of great teamwork. At Makers, I really enjoyed being part of different project teams as well as coding as a pair. This gave me the opportunity to experience coding with people of different strengths, to work on XP values, and taught me to learn and grow with others. I really enjoyed not being the smartest person in the room, and to discuss and tackle problems as a part of a team.


#### Organisation and time management

As a former scientist and account manager, one of the skills I am most proud of is to be organised, keeping to timelines as well as to budget. This skill has allowed me to target more realistic goals to achieve MVP during very short periods of time allocated for our projects at Makers.
